# Relay

This folder contains the public relay and push-service code used by agnt pairing and trusted reconnect.

The point of keeping this code in the repo is transparency: anyone forking agnt can inspect the transport boundary, verify the encrypted-session flow, and run a compatible relay of their own. What should stay private is the actual deployed endpoint and any production credentials.

## What It Does

- accepts WebSocket connections at `/relay/{sessionId}`
- pairs one Mac host with one live iPhone client for a session
- keeps an in-memory index of the current live session for each trusted Mac
- resolves the current live session for a previously trusted iPhone through an authenticated HTTP lookup
- forwards secure control messages and encrypted payloads between Mac and iPhone
- exposes optional HTTP endpoints for push registration and run-completion alerts only when push is enabled explicitly
- logs only connection metadata and payload sizes, not plaintext prompts or responses

## What It Does Not Do

- it does not run the agent CLI (Codex / Claude Code / opencode)
- it does not execute git commands
- it does not contain the user's repository checkout
- it does not decrypt agnt application payloads after the secure session is established

The agent CLI, git, and local file operations all run on the user's Mac.

## Security Model

agnt uses the relay as a transport hop, not as a trusted application server.

- The pairing QR gives the iPhone the bridge identity public key plus short-lived session details.
- After the first successful QR bootstrap, the relay can help the iPhone find the Mac's current live session again through a signed trusted-session resolve request.
- The iPhone and bridge perform a signed handshake, derive shared AES-256-GCM keys with X25519 + HKDF-SHA256, and then encrypt application payloads end to end.
- The relay can still observe connection metadata and the plaintext secure control messages needed to establish the encrypted session.
- The relay does not receive plaintext agnt application payloads after the secure session is active.

```

## Protocol Notes

- WebSocket path: `/relay/{sessionId}`
- required header: `x-role: mac` or `x-role: iphone`
- close code `4000`: invalid session or role
- close code `4001`: previous Mac connection replaced
- close code `4002`: session unavailable / Mac disconnected
- close code `4003`: previous iPhone connection replaced

Optional HTTP endpoints:

- `GET /health`
- `POST /v1/trusted/session/resolve`
- `POST /v1/push/session/register-device`
- `POST /v1/push/session/notify-completion`

The trusted-session resolve endpoint is intended for phones that have already completed the first QR bootstrap. It returns the current live session only after signature, nonce, and freshness checks pass.

Push is disabled by default. Enable it only when you are ready to wire APNs and the bridge-side `AGNT_PUSH_SERVICE_URL`, for example with `AGNT_ENABLE_PUSH_SERVICE=true`.

## Deploy Notes

- Keep the real relay base URL in private config such as `AGNT_RELAY`, not in committed source.
- Keep APNs credentials in private env vars or protected files (`AGNT_APNS_*`).
- Leave `AGNT_TRUST_PROXY` unset for direct/self-hosted installs. Set it to `true` only when a trusted reverse proxy is forwarding requests to this relay.
- When `AGNT_TRUST_PROXY=true`, configure the proxy to send sanitized client IP headers (`X-Real-Ip` and/or appended `X-Forwarded-For`) instead of passing client-supplied values through unchanged.
- If you expose the relay under a shared-domain prefix such as `/agnt`, have the proxy strip that prefix before forwarding so the Node server still receives `/relay/...` and `/v1/push/...`.
- The public repo should document the protocol and code, not your real deployed hostname or deploy defaults.

## Usage

```sh
cd relay
npm install
npm start
```

`server.js` exports `createRelayServer()`, and `relay.js` exports the lower-level `setupRelay(wss)` transport primitive if you want to embed the relay in your own server.
